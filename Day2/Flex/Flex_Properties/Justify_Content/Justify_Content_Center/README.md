# ðŸŽ¯ CSS `justify-content: center`

The **`justify-content`** property in CSS controls how flex items are aligned **along the main axis** (horizontal by default).

When set to **`center`**, it **horizontally centers** all items inside the flex container.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
This moves all child elements to the center of the container along the main axis.
