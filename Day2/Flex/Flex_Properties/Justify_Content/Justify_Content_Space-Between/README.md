
# ðŸŽ¯ CSS `justify-content: space-between`

The **`justify-content`** property in Flexbox defines how flex items are distributed along the **main axis**.  
Using **`space-between`**, items are spaced evenly â€” the **first item** is placed at the start, and the **last item** is placed at the end of the container.  
All remaining items are evenly distributed in between.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
````

This ensures:

* The first flex item is aligned to the **start**.
* The last flex item is aligned to the **end**.
* Equal space is distributed **between** all other items.

## ðŸ§© Example

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
  <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
  <div class="box3">Box 3</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightgray;
  height: 200px;
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Layout

```
[Box 1]      [Box 2]      [Box 3]
```

âœ… Boxes are spread out **evenly**, with **equal space between them**.
ðŸš« No space before the first or after the last box.
