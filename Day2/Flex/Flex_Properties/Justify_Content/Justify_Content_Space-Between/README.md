# ðŸŽ¯ CSS `justify-content: space-between`

The **`justify-content`** property in Flexbox defines how flex items are distributed along the **main axis**.  
Using **`space-between`**, items are spaced evenly â€” the **first item** is placed at the start, and the **last item** is placed at the end of the container.  
All remaining items are evenly distributed in between.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
This ensures:

The first flex item is aligned to the start.

The last flex item is aligned to the end.

Equal space between all other items.
