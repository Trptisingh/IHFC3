## 📂 Files in This Example

- **index.html** → Basic HTML page that links the JavaScript file  
- **script.js** → Contains all arithmetic operation examples and outputs results in the browser console

## ⚙️ How to Run the Example

1. Save both files (`index.html` and `script.js`) in the same folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
3. **Right-click → Inspect → Console tab** to view the output.

Expected output:
a = 20 , b = 5
Addition (a + b): 25
Subtraction (a - b): 15
Multiplication (a * b): 100
Division (a / b): 4
Modulus (a % b): 0
Exponentiation (a ** b): 3200000
After Increment (a++): 21
After Decrement (b--): 4
