# 🌐 CSS `display: inline` Property — Complete Guide

The **`display: inline`** property in CSS makes an element behave as an **inline element**.  
Inline elements do **not start on a new line**, and they only take up as much width as their content.

## 🧠 What Does `display: inline` Do?

When you apply `display: inline`, the element:
- Does **not start on a new line**
- Takes up **only as much width as necessary**
- **Ignores width and height** properties (they won’t have an effect)
- Can have **horizontal padding and margins**, but **vertical spacing** behaves differently

Example:
```html
<div style="display: inline; background-color: lightgreen; padding: 10px;">
  Inline Div
</div>

<div style="display: inline; background-color: lightpink; padding: 10px;">
  Another Inline Div
</div>
